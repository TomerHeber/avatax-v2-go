  DismissNotification marks a single notification as dismissed

  Marks the notification identified by this URL as dismissed.

A notification is a message from Avalara that may have relevance to your business.  You may want
to regularly review notifications and then dismiss them when you are certain that you have addressed
any relevant concerns raised by this notification.

An example of a notification would be a message about new software, or a change to AvaTax that may
affect you, or a potential issue with your company's tax profile.

When you dismiss a notification, the notification will track the user and time when it was
dismissed.  You can then later review which employees of your company dismissed notifications to
determine if they were resolved appropriately.

A Global notification with null accountId and companyId cannot be dismissed and will expire within a given time span.
