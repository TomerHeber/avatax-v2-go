  AddLines adds lines to an existing unlocked transaction

   Add lines to an existing unlocked transaction.

 The `AddLines` API allows you to add additional transaction lines to existing transaction, so that customer will
 be able to append multiple calls together and form an extremely large transaction. If customer does not specify line number
 in the lines to be added, a new random Guid string will be generated for line number. If customer are not satisfied with
 the line number for the transaction lines, they can turn on the renumber switch to have REST v2 automatically renumber all
 transaction lines for them, in this case, the line number becomes: "1", "2", "3", ...

 A transaction represents a unique potentially taxable action that your company has recorded, and transactions include actions like
 sales, purchases, inventory transfer, and returns (also called refunds).
 You may specify one or more of the following values in the `$include` parameter to fetch additional nested data, using commas to separate multiple values:

 * Lines
 * Details (implies lines)
 * Summary (implies details)
 * Addresses
* SummaryOnly (omit lines and details - reduces API response size)
* LinesOnly (omit details - reduces API response size)

 If you omit the `$include` parameter, the API will assume you want `Summary,Addresses`.

  AdjustTransaction corrects a previously created transaction

  Replaces the current transaction uniquely identified by this URL with a new transaction.

A transaction represents a unique potentially taxable action that your company has recorded, and transactions include actions like
sales, purchases, inventory transfer, and returns (also called refunds).

When you adjust a committed transaction, the original transaction will be updated with the status code `Adjusted`, and
both revisions will be available for retrieval based on their code and ID numbers.
Only transactions in `Committed` status are reported by Avalara Managed Returns.

Transactions that have been previously reported to a tax authority by Avalara Managed Returns are considered `locked` and are
no longer available for adjustments.

You may specify one or more of the following values in the `$include` parameter to fetch additional nested data, using commas to separate multiple values:

* Lines
* Details (implies lines)
* Summary (implies details)
* Addresses
* SummaryOnly (omit lines and details - reduces API response size)
* LinesOnly (omit details - reduces API response size)
* TaxDetailsByTaxType - Includes the aggregated tax, exempt tax, taxable and non-taxable for each tax type returned in the transaction summary.

NOTE: If your companyCode or transactionCode contains any of these characters /, +, ? or a space please use the following encoding before making a request:
* Replace '/' with '\_-ava2f-\_'  For example: document/Code becomes document_-ava2f-_Code
* Replace '+' with '\_-ava2b-\_'  For example: document+Code becomes document_-ava2b-_Code
* Replace '?' with '\_-ava3f-\_'  For example: document?Code becomes document_-ava3f-_Code

  CreateOrAdjustTransaction creates or adjust a transaction

  Records a new transaction or adjust an existing transaction in AvaTax.

The `CreateOrAdjustTransaction` endpoint is used to create a new transaction or update an existing one.  This API
can help you create an idempotent service that creates transactions
If there exists a transaction identified by code, the original transaction will be adjusted by using the meta data
in the input transaction.

The `CreateOrAdjustTransaction` API cannot modify any transaction that has been reported to a tax authority using
the Avalara Managed Returns Service or any other tax filing service.  If you call this API to attempt to modify
a transaction that has been reported on a tax filing, you will receive the error `CannotModifyLockedTransaction`.

To generate a refund for a transaction, use the `RefundTransaction` API.

If you don't specify the field `type` in your request, you will get an estimate of type `SalesOrder`, which will not be recorded in the database.

A transaction represents a unique potentially taxable action that your company has recorded, and transactions include actions like
sales, purchases, inventory transfer, and returns (also called refunds).
You may specify one or more of the following values in the `$include` parameter to fetch additional nested data, using commas to separate multiple values:

* Lines
* Details (implies lines)
* Summary (implies details)
* Addresses
* SummaryOnly (omit lines and details - reduces API response size)

  CreateTransaction creates a new transaction

  Records a new transaction in AvaTax.

A transaction represents a unique potentially taxable action that your company has recorded, and transactions include actions like
sales, purchases, inventory transfer, and returns (also called refunds).

The `CreateTransaction` endpoint uses the tax profile of your company to identify the correct tax rules
and rates to apply to all line items in this transaction.  The end result will be the total tax calculated by AvaTax based on your
company's configuration and the data provided in this API call.

The `CreateTransaction` API will report an error if a committed transaction already exists with the same `code`.  To
avoid this error, use the `CreateOrAdjustTransaction` API - it will create the transaction if it does not exist, or
update it if it does exist.

To generate a refund for a transaction, use the `RefundTransaction` API.

The field `type` identifies the kind of transaction - for example, a sale, purchase, or refund.  If you do not specify
a `type` value, you will receive an estimate of type `SalesOrder`, which will not be recorded.

The origin and destination locations for a transaction must be identified by either address or geocode.  For address-based transactions, please
provide addresses in the fields `line`, `city`, `region`, `country` and `postalCode`.  For geocode-based transactions, please provide the geocode
information in the fields `latitude` and `longitude`.  If either `latitude` or `longitude` or both are null, the transaction will be calculated
using the best available address location information.

You may specify one or more of the following values in the `$include` parameter to fetch additional nested data, using commas to separate multiple values:

* Lines
* Details (implies lines)
* Summary (implies details)
* Addresses
* SummaryOnly (omit lines and details - reduces API response size)
* LinesOnly (omit details - reduces API response size)
* ForceTimeout - Simulates a timeout.  This adds a 30 second delay and error to your API call.  This can be used to test your code to ensure it can respond correctly in the case of a dropped connection.
* TaxDetailsByTaxType - Includes the aggregated tax, exempt tax, taxable and non-taxable for each tax type returned in the transaction summary.

If you omit the `$include` parameter, the API will assume you want `Summary,Addresses`.

NOTE: Avoid using the following strings in your transaction codes as they are encoding strings and will be interpreted differently:
* \_-ava2f-\_
* \_-ava2b-\_
* \_-ava3f-\_

  RefundTransaction creates a refund for a transaction

  Create a refund for a transaction.

The `RefundTransaction` API allows you to quickly and easily create a `ReturnInvoice` representing a refund
for a previously created `SalesInvoice` transaction.  You can choose to create a full or partial refund, and
specify individual line items from the original sale for refund.

The `RefundTransaction` API ensures that the tax amount you refund to the customer exactly matches the tax that
was calculated during the original transaction, regardless of any changes to your company's configuration, rules,
nexus, or any other setting.

This API is intended to be a shortcut to allow you to quickly and accurately generate a refund for the following
common refund scenarios:

* A full refund of a previous sale
* Refunding the tax that was charged on a previous sale, when the customer provides an exemption certificate after the purchase
* Refunding one or more items (lines) from a previous sale
* Granting a customer a percentage refund of a previous sale

For more complex scenarios than the ones above, please use `CreateTransaction` with document type `ReturnInvoice` to
create a custom refund transaction.

You may specify one or more of the following values in the `$include` parameter to fetch additional nested data, using commas to separate multiple values:

* Lines
* Details (implies lines)
* Summary (implies details)
* Addresses
* SummaryOnly (omit lines and details - reduces API response size)
* LinesOnly (omit details - reduces API response size)
* TaxDetailsByTaxType - Includes the aggregated tax, exempt tax, taxable and non-taxable for each tax type returned in the transaction summary.
If you omit the `$include` parameter, the API will assume you want `Summary,Addresses`.

  SettleTransaction performs multiple actions on a transaction

  Performs one or more actions against the current transaction uniquely identified by this URL.

The `SettleTransaction` API call can perform the work of `ChangeCode`, `VerifyTransaction`, and `CommitTransaction`.

A transaction represents a unique potentially taxable action that your company has recorded, and transactions include actions like
sales, purchases, inventory transfer, and returns (also called refunds).

If you have more than one document with the same `code`, specify the `documentType` parameter to choose between them.

This API is available for users who want to execute more than one action at a time.

You may specify one or more of the following values in the `$include` parameter to fetch additional nested data, using commas to separate multiple values:

* Lines
* Details (implies lines)
* Summary (implies details)
* Addresses
* SummaryOnly (omit lines and details - reduces API response size)
* LinesOnly (omit details - reduces API response size)
* TaxDetailsByTaxType - Includes the aggregated tax, exempt tax, taxable and non-taxable for each tax type returned in the transaction summary.

NOTE: If your companyCode or transactionCode contains any of these characters /, +, ? or a space please use the following encoding before making a request:
* Replace '/' with '\_-ava2f-\_'  For example: document/Code becomes document_-ava2f-_Code
* Replace '+' with '\_-ava2b-\_'  For example: document+Code becomes document_-ava2b-_Code
