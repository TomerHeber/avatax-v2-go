  CreateTaxRules creates a new tax rule

  Create one or more custom tax rules attached to this company.

A tax rule represents a rule that changes the default AvaTax behavior for a product or jurisdiction.  Custom tax rules
can be used to change the taxability of an item, to change the tax base of an item, or to change the tax rate
charged when selling an item.  Tax rules can also change tax behavior depending on the `entityUseCode` value submitted
with the transaction.

You can create custom tax rules to customize the behavior of AvaTax to match specific rules that are custom to your
business.  If you have obtained a ruling from a tax auditor that requires custom tax calculations, you can use
custom tax rules to redefine the behavior for your company or item.

Please use custom tax rules carefully and ensure that these tax rules match the behavior agreed upon with your
auditor, legal representative, and accounting team.
