  CreateSettings creates a new setting

  Create one or more new setting objects attached to this company.

The company settings system is a metadata system that you can use to store extra information
about a company.  Your integration or connector could use this data storage to keep track of
preference information, reminders, or any other storage that would need to persist even if
the customer uninstalls your application.

A setting can refer to any type of data you need to remember about this company object.
When creating this object, you may define your own `set`, `name`, and `value` parameters.
To define your own values, please choose a `set` name that begins with `X-` to indicate an extension.

Use Set = Transactions, Name = TaxCodePrioritization/HSCodePrioritization and Value = Transaction/ItemMaster for prioritizing which TaxCodes/HsCodes should be used for calculating taxes.

Example: To prioritize TaxCodes passed in a Transaction over values stored with Items when calculating tax, use
Set = Transactions, Name = TaxCodePrioritization, Value = Transaction
