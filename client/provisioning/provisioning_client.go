  RequestNewAccount requests a new avalara account

  This API is for use by partner provisioning services customers only.

Avalara invites select partners to refer new customers to the AvaTax service using the onboarding features
of AvaTax.  These partners can create accounts for new customers using this API.

Calling this API creates an account with the specified product subscriptions, but does not configure billing.
The customer will receive information from Avalara about how to configure billing for their account.
You should call this API when a customer has requested to begin using Avalara services.

If the newly created account owner wishes, they can confirm that they have read and agree to the Avalara
terms and conditions.  If they do so, they can receive a license key as part of this API and their
API will be created in `Active` status.  If the customer has not yet read and accepted these terms and
conditions, the account will be created in `New` status and they can receive a license key by logging
onto the AvaTax website and reviewing terms and conditions online.
