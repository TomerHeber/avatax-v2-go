  ResolveAddress retrieves geolocation information for a specified address

  Resolve an address against Avalara's address-validation system.  If the address can be resolved, this API
provides the latitude and longitude of the resolved location.  The value 'resolutionQuality' can be used
to identify how closely this address can be located.  If the address cannot be clearly located, use the
'messages' structure to learn more about problems with this address.
This is the same API as the POST /api/v2/addresses/resolve endpoint.
Both verbs are supported to provide for flexible implementation.

In order to get any evaluation for an address, please provide at least one of the following fields/pairs:
1. postal code
2. line1 + city + region
3. line1 + postal code
